# Deleting the Deployment

Deployment of this solution template will provision resources in your subscription and you will be billed for the usage. If you want to discard this deployment, we recommend deleting the resources that were provisioned so that you are not billed for the usage. Since deleting the deployment will also remove any data in the Blob and other stores, consider backing up your data before deleting the deployment.

Delete the deployment as follows:

## Delete the resource group
1. Find your deployment resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click on 'Delete resource group' and follow the prompts to delete the resource group.
3. If you have locks that are preventing deletion of the resource group, you will have to find and delete them in the Locks pane for your resource group.

## Delete the deployment in the Cloud Intelligence Solution Deployments
Find your [deployments on Cloud Intelligence Solutions](https://quickstart.azure.ai/Deployments/) and delete it.
