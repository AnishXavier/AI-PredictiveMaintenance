The solution template recommends using DSVM as the central developer workstation. From this workstation, you can experiment with models locally using the various pre-installed tools - Jupyter Notebooks being one of them. This solution template will offer multiple solutions for different PdM problems such as (1) Failure detection of equipment based on real-time sensor data - the default solution in the template (2) Predict the failure of an equipment over the next N days/months (3) Estimate remaining useful lifetime of an equipment, with more added via contributions from users like you. Each solution follows the steps of feature engineering, model creation, model test and model operationalization. These steps are implemented in Python/PySpark and executed in Jupyter Notebooks.

Provision the DSVM by giving it a username and password, and choose an appropriate DSVM size. A DSVM will be created in the resource group name that you specified in the previous step.
