# Model Train and Test

AI application development using Python is predominantly done in Notebooks. [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) is the most popular; other examples are Azure Notebooks, DataBricks Notebooks, and so on. Notebooks foster a development practice where documentation is interspersed with the code. Notebooks also provide an in-place execution environment for the Python code. Given this context, almost all of model train and test documentation will be in Notebooks.

This section directs the reader to notebooks for each use case, and provides additional information where necessary.
